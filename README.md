# The epispot manual

**Not production ready**

This is the official manual to the epispot package. It includes background information on the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, the motivation behind the epispot package, a complete guide to using epispot and understanding its documentation, and a full explanation of the epispot development process. As epispot grows, this manual is subject to change and will be versioned on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/epispot/manual/releases). This current version of the manual is maintained at [https://github.com/epispot/manual](https://github.com/epispot/manual) and ported to both HTML and PDF formats via GitBook.
