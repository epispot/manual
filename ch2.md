### 2.1 Visualizing Compartmental Models

The idea of compartmental models that we've built up in Chapter 1 is extremely useful for deriving equations, but not for really planning out the model. That is because one compartment can connect to two other compartments which can connect back to another compartment. In reality, compartmental models are complex webs of interactions between compartments. In order to truly capture this complexity, we need a way to express it.

In this chapter, we will see how to think about compartmental models visually, which will help us compile models in epispot later on. For now, we'll focus on the basic SIR model.

#### 2.1.1 The SIR Model

We start with the SIR model because it is the simplest model in compartmental modeling, with only three compartments. In order to really _visualize_ the SIR model, we need to think of each of its compartments as boxes:
