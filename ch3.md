### 3.1 Introduction

Epispot is built on open-source contributions and we're glad that you want to contribute. First things first, if you want to contribute you will need the link to the GitHub source: [https://github.com/epispot/epispot](https://github.com/epispot/epispot). All contributions to epispot should be submitted as pull requests on GitHub which we can then merge. In order to facilitate this review process, epispot has created a set of contributing guidelines which you can view [here](https://github.com/epispot/epispot/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The goal of this page in the manual is to further expand on some of the principles touched on in that document and make it easier to contribute to epispot. Continue reading to learn how to start.
